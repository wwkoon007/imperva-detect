Utility to very quickly detect presence of an Imperva web application firewall (WAF) using a baseline test + 5 additional tests.  This utility is best used for validating coverage of environment that you already know contains an Imperva WAF as it typically only requires 2-3 seconds per host for the tests-- much faster than some of the other tools.

For a tool to detect a variety of other WAF appliances, see http://code.google.com/p/waffit/
